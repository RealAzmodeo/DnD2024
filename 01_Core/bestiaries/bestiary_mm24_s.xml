    <description>Sahuagin are fiendish terrors that prey on creatures above and below the water. Called "sea devils" by residents of coastal communities, sahuagin are ruthless raiders. They ransack ships, fishing villages, and undersea communities to slake their bloodthirst, claim treasure, and make sacrifices to their vicious deity—the sharklike god Sekolah.
	Sahuagin constantly war on any peoples living near their territory. Merfolk and other aquatic folk bear the brunt of these attacks, but sahuagin also hunt air-breathers who sail over or swim through the waters the sea devils claim. Sahuagin often attack alongside sharks, which they can telepathically command.

Sahuagin Baron:
During times of great conflict, Sekolah blesses particularly ruthless sahuagin warriors with increased size and an additional pair of arms, transforming them into sahuagin barons. These boons elevate the recipients' status among their kind, and they become champions or leaders. Sahuagin barons' blood is infused with profane magic capable of searing their enemies and making these foes irresistible targets for other Fiends.

Sahuagin Priest:
Sahuagin priests serve the will of Sekolah or other fiendish masters. They direct and support other sahuagin, and they consider every combatant that falls in battle—whether enemy or ally—a sacrifice to their fierce deities.

Sahuagin Warrior:
Sahuagin warriors are vicious combatants that savage their foes with webbed claws. Once sahuagin draw blood, they usually attack until either they or their foe is slain.

    <description>Salamanders are serpentine denizens of the Elemental Plane of Fire. They believe that flames expose the purest forms of all things and delight in burning and melting things, seeing fleeting beauty and striking nuances in blazes consuming different fuels—ancient forests, artistic masterpieces, or living creatures. To salamanders, those that can't endure their flames are nothing but ashes in disguise. They harbor malice toward few creatures, but they consider creating remarkable flames more important than the pain and loss their fires cause.
	Salamanders are typically content to dwell on the Elemental Plane of Fire, creating strange, temporary art amid the flames. Some travel to other planes of existence and worlds to experience the flames of other realms or create conflagrations of unprecedented scale.

Salamander:
Most salamanders are arrogant yet curious, seeking to create artful blazes or burn that which has never been burned. They eagerly explain their work to strangers before trying to determine how the strangers burn. Salamanders radiate intense heat, which is conducted by their blazing weapons.

Salamander Fire Snake:
Juvenile salamanders emerge from burning hot, two-foot-diameter eggs. Called fire snakes, these serpentlike creatures slither through the Plane of Fire and other intensely hot places. After consuming the proper fuels and exposing themselves to fiery extremes, fire snakes grow into salamanders.

They gather communes of apprentices who learn fiery techniques while helping their mentors accomplish great works. Inferno masters have ambitious goals, such as causing massive volcanic eruptions, opening portals to burning planes, destroying Artifacts, or burning all instances of something from the multiverse.

    <description>Spirits of vengeance bound to crude frames, scarecrows arise from folk magic, the prayers of desperate commoners, or possession by spirits that died with violent work left undone. Scarecrows might serve those who created them or might defend a place, family, or community from threats—whether physical or to their way of life.
	Although scarecrows take their name from rural eﬃgies, they might take varied patchwork forms. Roll on or choose a result from the Scarecrow Frames table to inspire a scarecrow's appearance.

Scarecrow Frames:
1d8 | The Scarecrow Is Made From...
1 | Animal furs, bones, horns, and claws.
2 | Beehives or wasp nests over a wicker frame.
3 | A carved pumpkin atop a body of thick vines.
4 | Nets, flotsam, grapnels, and fishing tackle.
5 | Oversize stuffed animal or mannequin parts.
6 | Rusty armor and torture devices.
7 | A sackcloth head atop straw-stuffed clothes.
8 | Wedding clothes that were never worn.

    <description>Sea hags loathe peace and beauty. Bitter, jealous creatures, they spread chaos and undermine joy however they can, undertaking elaborate deceptions to sow discord for its own sake. The hags' true forms are supernaturally vile, and their baleful gazes can strike down creatures frightened by their appearance.
	Sea hags cloak themselves in illusions to work their schemes. Roll on or choose a result from the Sea Hag Disguises table to inspire a sea hag's illusion and how they might use it to wreak chaos and destruction.

Sea Hag Disguises:
1d6 The Sea Hag Takes the Form of A...
1 | Captive and claims nearby villagers bound them and left them to drown.
2 | Castaway and shares a cursed item's location with would-be rescuers.
3 | Healer and passes off poisons as medicine.
4 | Panic-spreading prophesier of doom.
5 | Ship captain and delivers passengers to the hag's pet sea monster.
6 | Wounded sailor and claims their ship was destroyed by merfolk or other peaceful people.

    <description>Shadows are incorporeal Undead that feed on life. They resent the living for possessing the potential and vitality lost to them.
	Shadows lurk in dark, lonely places, typically sites that were meaningful to them in life or cursed places with ties to death, sinister magic, or the Shadowfell. Their victims rise as new shadows and prey on the living.
	Shadows might resemble the silhouettes of who they were in life or take on more menacing forms. Roll on or choose a result from the Shadow Shapes table to inspire a shadow's form and haunting.

Shadow Shapes:
1d6 | The Shadow Appears As...
1 | A distorted stalker that lurks in the woods.
2 | A fiend that dwells near a wicked ritual site.
3 | Grasping hands that haunt a miser's home.
4 | A grim storybook character that follows those who speak its name.
5 | Its target, acting in eerie pantomime.
6 | An ominous priest that haunts a defiled site.

    <description>Shadow demons form when exceptionally wicked demons are destroyed and prevented from reconstituting their physical forms in the Abyss. This might occur due to divine intervention, when a demon is destroyed in the Abyss, or under more unusual circumstances. Shadow demons are the incorporeal remnants of these destroyed demons' evil. They usually vaguely resemble their former shapes, but some take purposefully deceptive shapes. Many lurk in dark places or venture out only at night to hide their true forms from those they manipulate.
	Shadow demons seek ways to regain their former might and take revenge on those who destroyed them. They often ingratiate themselves with more powerful demons or mortal spellcasters, bargaining with and coercing others into restoring them to power. Many try to claim or corrupt souls to restore their fiendish forms, while some shadow demons seek wicked relics or nexuses of profane magic. It typically takes shadow demons centuries to recover their demonic power, if they ever do.
	Particularly powerful demons might return as multiple shadow demons after being defeated. These fiendish entities each think they're the true manifestation of their past self and hunt one another to recover their power.
	In rare cases, Fiends other than demons might adopt forms similar to shadow demons.

	The region around a shadow dragon's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

Negative Energy Suffusion: Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains Hit Points from a spell, it subtracts 1d10 from the number of Hit Points regained.

Stifling Shadows: Within 1 mile of the lair, effects that normally create Bright Light instead create Dim Light, and creatures there have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</text>

    <description>Shadow dragons haunt forgotten, lightless places. While they might have once been other types of dragons, the influence of planar forces, negative energy, or sinister magic has stripped them of their former color or luster. In place of any former breath weapon, shadow dragons exhale caliginous gouts that saps life from everything it touches. Those slain by a shadow dragon's breath rise as shades obedient to the shadow dragon's will.
	Shadow dragons typically dwell in the Underdark, particularly in areas with connections to the Shadowfell or other tenebrous realms. In some cases, they might lurk in dark, corrupted reaches of the regions they preferred before transforming into shadow dragons. Overgrown swamps, sepulchral desert ruins, and ash-choked volcanoes make natural lairs for shadow dragons.
	Like many other dragons, shadow dragons collect hoards. Their tastes tend to be morbid—collecting coins from ruined empires and their victims' skulls.

    <description>Shambling mounds—also known as "shamblers"—embody the tenacity of the wilderness, seeking only to consume and grow. These masses of vegetation rise up to half again as tall as a human and possess thick limbs and a vague head. As they move through bogs and undergrowth, they ensnare creatures that come within reach. Shambling mounds bury those they catch within their own forms as compost.
	Strange circumstances might give rise to shambling mounds, transforming vegetation into hulks with rudimentary cunning. Such conditions include strikes from magical lightning, nature defending itself, or druidic curses. Roll on or choose a result from the Shambling Mound Cultivation table to inspire a shambling mound's origins and features.

Shambling Mound Cultivation:
1d6 | The Shambling Mound Is...
1 | Covered in vibrant alien or Feywild blooms.
2 | Hauling a rune-etched menhir in its torso.
3 | Infested with vermin or fungi.
4 | Made up of knotty vines entangling skeletons.
5 | Mutated and leaking glowing pollution.
6 | The remains of an ancient tree or a treant.

    <description>An intimidating magical automaton, a shield guardian obeys its master's commands and protects its master from danger. When such a guardian is created, the magic that animates it is intertwined with a bonded command amulet. Any creature that has a shield guardian's command amulet can control that Construct and, in the case of magic-users, imbue it with a spell to unleash under predetermined circumstances. Yet a shield guardian's primary goal is to protect its master. It escorts whoever bears its command amulet and intercedes between the bearer and any threat. Although it isn't mindless, a shield guardian has no sense of self preservation and will sacrifice itself to protect its master.
	Shield guardians are typically constructed of steel, stone, and wood in the shape of watchful soldiers. More fanciful designs exist, reflecting the tastes of their creators. Given their resilience, it's common for shield guardians to eventually serve creatures other than their creators. A shield guardian's command amulet might be passed down through a magic-using society or family for generations.

    <description>Silver dragons work to preserve peace and encourage greatness. They try to live as examples of decency while remaining watchful against evil.
	Silver dragons typically dwell amid snow-capped mountains, though aspirations and congeniality drive some to instead live among cosmopolitan societies. Disguised as humanoids, they ally with artists, historians, knights, and humble leaders who learn from the past to create better futures.
	Silver dragons take inspiration from legendary heroes and have grand ambitions. Many collect treasures that reflect these interests, such as histories, ancient art, and the gear of famous champions.

Silver Dragon Wyrmling:
Silver dragon wyrmlings typically live with one or more parents or mentors, learning much about the world and its past before living on their own.

    <description>Skeletons rise at the summons of necromancers and foul spirits. Whether they're the remains of the ancient dead or fresh bones bound to morbid ambitions, they commit deathless work for whatever forces reanimated them, often serving as guardians, soldiers, or laborers. In rare cases, skeletons are reanimated but given no particular direction. Roll on or choose a result from the Skeleton Pantomimes table to inspire how undirected skeletons behave.

Skeleton Pantomimes:
1d6 | Left to Its Own Devices, the Skeleton...
1 | Delivers meal salvers or ages-old correspondence to the crypt of its dead master.
2 | Endlessly trains in battle with other skeletons, despite being hacked to animate splinters.
3 | Mimics ways it entertained itself in life, such as acting, dancing, or reading.
4 | Performs a familiar task, such as cleaning, cooking, mining, or praying.
5 | Repeats its final moments of life.
6 | Stands guard at the post it protected in life.

Skeleton:
Skeletons are reanimated Humanoid bones bearing the equipment they had in life. They have rudimentary faculties and greater agility than zombies and similar shambling corpses. While they aren't capable of creating plans of their own, they avoid obvious barriers and self-destructive situations.

    <description>Unpredictable slaadi devour and multiply across the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo. These toadlike, extraplanar beings embody the endless potentiality of their home plane of existence. While slaadi aren't inherently evil, their impulses are wild and often destructive. Many are driven to propagate through supernatural processes. Unfortunately, these processes typically are fatal for other creatures.
	Slaadi have no formal society. Rather, strong slaadi dominate weaker ones. Blue and red slaadi rampage across Limbo and spill into other worlds at the direction of green slaadi. More powerful slaadi have connections to the Spawning Stone, a source of chaotic magic from which the first slaadi originated. The Spawning Stone is hidden deep within Limbo, and legends tie its origins to the modron overlord Primus or the ruinous slaad lords, such as Ssendam, the golden amoeboid terror, and Ygorl, the winged skeleton. These slaad lords and others plot to spread slaadi across the multiverse.

Salad Control Gems:
A salad born from the Spawning Stone has a magical control gem embedded in its head. If a creature claims the gem, the salad has the Charmed condition and obeys the gem's bearer. The salad ceases to be Charmed if it is harmed by the gem's bearer or the bearer's allies or if the gem is returned to the salad. A Greater Restoration spell cast on a salad destroys the gem, and the salad ceases to be Charmed. One can obtain a salad's control gem using a Wish or Imprisonment spell. If the salad fails its saving throw against Imprisonment, the caster against the gem, and the salad isn't imprisoned. An Incapacitated salads control gem can be removed by spending 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Failing this check deals 22 (4d10) piercing damage to the salad.

Slaad Tadpole:
Slaad tadpoles are ravenous, newborn slaadi. They hatch from eggs implanted into living hosts by red slaadi, but they also appear in great numbers in Limbo and other chaotic realms. Under most conditions, a slaad tadpole transforms into a blue slaad—or a green slaad if its host was able to cast spells of level 3 or higher—within 2d12 hours of hatching.

    <description>Mephits are mean-spirited tricksters that dwell on the Elemental Planes. The six most prominent types of mephits resemble halfling-size gargoyles with wings, exaggerated features, and bodies composed of two elements. Most live self-interested existences, indulging their warped senses of humor or overblown egos on their home planes of existence. Some serve as messengers or spies for genies or magic-users.
	Mephits resent leaving the elemental extremes where they make their homes. If loosed on the Material Plane or other realms, they lash out with nasty pranks or by tormenting weaker creatures. When destroyed, mephits explode in a burst of elemental magic.

Smoke Mephit:
Smoke mephits are elusive beings formed of fiery cinders and hot air. They love misleading creatures and then mocking them for their gullibility.

    <description>Invoking mysterious rites involving four beholder eyestalks, a spellcaster can mold aberrant dreams into a beholder-like guardian. Called a spectator, the being summoned by such a ritual resembles a beholder with five magical eyes—a central eye and four on stalks arrayed around the crown of the creature's spherical body.
	A spectator serves its conjurer for 101 years by guarding something of the spellcaster's choice—typically a treasure or location. The spectator is a reliable guardian and allows only its summoner access to what it protects. A spectator might converse with other creatures, openly discussing its orders and the magic-user who conjured it, but it has no ambitions of its own and won't abandon its post. Should an intruder ignore its warnings, a spectator attempts to drive away the intruder with its magical eye rays.
	At the end of its service, a spectator might discorporate back into nothingness or wander away, seeking to learn more of the multiverse.

      <text>Sphinxes typically dwell in places that hold great knowledge or prophetic magic.
	The region containing a sphinx of lore's or sphinx of valor's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

Distant Sight: While in its lair, the sphinx can cast Clairvoyance, requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When cast this way, the spell's range is 1 mile.

Infusion of Knowledge: Whenever the sphinx or one of its allies takes a Study action while within 1 mile of the lair, it adds 1d6 to any ability check it makes for that action.

If the sphinx dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</text>

    <description>Sphinxes protect the secrets of the multiverse. Formed from the spirits of sages and explorers, sphinxes know the power of truth and the importance of preserving it. They share their wisdom only with those who prove themselves wise or overcome tests of worthiness, such as riddles or battles with dangerous beasts. Through their existences, sphinxes might change form as they gain more nuanced understanding of cosmic enigmas.

Sphinx of Lore:
Sphinxes of lore each know a great secret and protect it all costs. This truth might take the form of an ancient text, a magical puzzle, or a path to another world. These sphinxes might gain reputations as sages or oracles, but they typically dwell far from civilization.

Sphinx of Secrets:
Sphinxes of secrets are commonly associated with a site of great magic or learning. These immortal beings often outlive such locations, though, and might protect a site's ruins as they continue their own studies. Sphinxes of secrets fiercely guard their dwellings and research.

Sphinx of Valor:
Sphinxes of valor guard world-changing or dangerous secrets—evidence of weird truths, deadly Artifacts, and things that shouldn't exist. They inhabit hidden, magical sites and hold their duty above mortal life. If threatened, a sphinx of valor defends its charge with its supernaturally empowered roar and fierce strikes.

Sphinx of Wonder:
A sphinx of wonder is brightly feathered and the size of a lion cub. One comes into being every time a unique idea is conceived on the Material Plane. Each sphinx of wonder is fascinated by a particular type of story or field of study, and it learns all it can about that topic. It bears a unique sigil on its forehead that suggests the type of knowledge that fascinates it. Sometimes, a sphinx of wonder forms a bond with a mortal scholar and aids them in their research.

They prefer to attack from the air, flinging wicked barbs while staying out of reach of foes. Spined devils collect information to gain leverage over mortals or to entice powerful devils. Roll on or choose a result from the Spined Devil Intelligence table to inspire what information a spined devil seeks or already possesses.

Spined Devil Intelligence:
1d6 | The Spined Devil Covets Information About...
1 | Artifacts, their locations, and their owners.
2 | Betrayals by infernal allies or other devils.
3 | Crimes or deceptions by influential leaders.
4 | The identities of incognito individuals.
5 | The movements of extraplanar armies.
6 | Prophecies or secrets hidden by gods.

    <description>Spirit nagas loathe the world and all creatures. Possessing perfect memories, these venomous, cobra-like creatures recall every slight committed against them during their immortal existences. In their dank, joyless lairs, they create vicious plots to avenge themselves against even petty offenses.
	Spirit nagas seek to claim what they believe they deserve. Their schemes often involve poisons, vile spells, cursed objects, or magical compulsions, eventually making them wellsprings of diabolical knowledge and evil inspiration. Other villains often seek out spirit nagas as advisers and allies. Roll on or choose a result from the Spirit Naga Grievances table to inspire what motivates a spirit naga's schemes.

Spirit Naga Grievances:
1d6 | The Spirit Naga Believes...
1 | A character is to blame for its recent failures.
2 | It has been evicted from its rightful home.
3 | Locals have reneged on an age-old bargain.
4 | Other creatures are mocking it.
5 | A rival is spying on it.
6 | Someone's treasure rightfully belongs to it.

    <description>Sprites dwell in mystical forests touched by the magic of the Feywild, living peacefully with most other Fey and friends of nature. These foot-tall spirits of nature resemble elves with exaggerated, whimsical features and gossamer wings.
	Sprites can sense the innate goodness or wickedness of other creatures. Those that enter their realms with good intentions might be treated to tiny feasts and celebrations. The wicked face nasty tricks and bold ambushes at the hands of invisible sprite defenders. These woodland guardians enchant the arrows of their tiny bows with charming magic that can pierce the heart of the fiercest foe. Sprites oppose any creatures that seek to harm places of natural magic and beauty. This can put them into conflict with would-be settlers, monsters like ettercaps, and despoilers such as goblinoids and hags. They frequently aid other good creatures of the forest, including treants and unicorns, in defending their homes.

    <description>Mephits are mean-spirited tricksters that dwell on the Elemental Planes. The six most prominent types of mephits resemble halfling-size gargoyles with wings, exaggerated features, and bodies composed of two elements. Most live self-interested existences, indulging their warped senses of humor or overblown egos on their home planes of existence. Some serve as messengers or spies for genies or magic-users.
	Mephits resent leaving the elemental extremes where they make their homes. If loosed on the Material Plane or other realms, they lash out with nasty pranks or by tormenting weaker creatures. When destroyed, mephits explode in a burst of elemental magic.

Steam Mephit:
These arrogant mephits are made of heat and vaporous water. They often trick creatures into doing them favors, then renege on promised rewards.

Stirge:
A single stirge is usually little more than an annoyance, but several can be deadly if they attach faster than a victim can remove them.

    <description>In cavernous depths and amid mountain canyons, stone giants contemplate the strength and persistence of the earth. Stone giants have rugged features and skin with patterns and hues similar to the rock common near their homes. This makes them adept at blending in with their stony surroundings despite their size.
	Stone giants rarely interfere in the affairs of other creatures, whether their smaller neighbors or other Giants. Most are slow to act, preferring to weather hardships or wait out perilous times. When roused to action—particularly when sites of ancient wonder or their homes are threatened—stone giants can unleash the might of mountains and crush foes with the force of an avalanche.
	Stone giants often ponder the mysteries of natural wonders, such as mountain spires, crystal formations, or mystical petroglyphs. Some know much about the magic and secret messages hidden within the earth. Those who confine themselves to the Underdark often regard the surface world and its inhabitants as dreams imagined into being by slumbering primordials, strange gods, or other entities.

    <description>Stone golems take varied forms, such as weathered carvings of ancient deities, lifelike sculptures of heroes, or any other shape their makers imagine. No matter their design or the rock from which they're crafted, these golems are strengthened by the magic that animates them, allowing them to follow their creators' orders for centuries.
	Stone golems are typically created to protect places of significance to a group, such as a monument to an important event, a leader's tomb, or a faith's sanctuary. Roll on or choose a result from the Stone Golem Orders table to inspire the commands a stone golem follows.

Stone Golem Orders:
1d6 | The Stone Golem Follows Orders To...
1 | Allow only those wearing ritual garb to pass.
2 | Cast Slow on and aid in apprehending anyone who touches a city's prized relic.
3 | Destroy a dam or bridge at the command of one bearing a ruler's medallion of oﬃce.
4 | Obey whoever places a missing crest in its chest, then deactivate for a year.
5 | Reveal a hidden passage to those who recite a leader's final words.
6 | Watch for and do battle with the type of monster that slew the hero it resembles.

    <description>Among the tallest giants, storm giants live amid extreme forces of nature.

More often, though, these giants watch the rise and fall of nations and interpret supernatural omens, interfering in the world only when they're needed most.

    <description>Succubi prey on mortals physically and exploit their waking desires. They relish corrupting virtuous souls and the pain an individual's downfall can cause. Once their targets are at their lowest, succubi slay their victims with their essence-draining kiss.
	Through fiendish rites, succubi can transform into incubi to manipulate their prey in dreams as well as the waking world. They can also change shape to torment their victims. These tempters can dominate Humanoids, but they usually do so to reinforce their manipulations or defend themselves rather than controlling others outright. Roll on or choose a result from the Succubus Temptations table to inspire how a succubus toys with its victims.

Succubus Temptations:
1d6 | The Succubus Manipulates Its Target By...
1 | Adopting the form of a lost loved one.
2 | Charming someone close to its target.
3 | I solating them from their loved ones.
4 | Manipulating events to bring surprise fortune.
5 | Posing as a flattering underling.
6 | Taking the form of one in need of protection.

    <description>Crawling claws are severed hands that move and act of their own murderous accord. These deathless appendages can spring to life from the severed limbs of killers and villains, and sinister magic-users might animate crawling claws as foul servants. Crawling claws appear in a variety of forms, from decaying human hands to the fresh appendages of animals or monsters.

Swarms of crawling claws are typically animated by depraved necromancers. Occasionally, these grotesque swarms arise from mass graves or after tragedies, refusing to let their murderers escape their grasp.

Swarm of Dretches:
Swarms of dretches sometimes escape the Abyss onto other planes of existence, or they might be part of a demonic invasion. Without direction, these crude demons rampage and despoil with cruel enthusiasm.

    <description>Souls condemned to the Lower Planes often become larvae—repulsive, maggot-like creatures with twisted features evocative of those they possessed in life. These pathetic creatures are nearly helpless and struggle to escape the attention of the more powerful inhabitants of the Lower Planes. Many Fiends view larvae as delicacies to be consumed, while evil magic-users find larvae useful for depraved rituals. Night hags frequently collect and herd larvae, trading them to nefarious parties across the multiverse.
	Larvae that survive on the Lower Planes long enough can eventually transform into other sorts of lesser Fiends.

Swarm of Larvae:
Lone larvae pose little threat, but in large numbers, larvae can overwhelm vulnerable creatures. Out of desperation, larvae band together in grotesque swarms, their squirming stampedes heralded by a din of wordless whimpers and stomach-turning worm sounds.

    <description>Stirges are bat-size vermin with dagger-length proboscises that attach to other creatures and drain life from them. Stirges are most active at night and hide in shadowy places during the day. If disturbed, they take flight and defend themselves. Roll on or choose a result from the Stirge Roosts table to inspire where stirges might lurk.

Stirge Roosts:
1d4 | Between Hunts, the Stirge Lurks In...
1 | The attic or furniture of a ruined building.
2 | A cave or narrow crevice.
3 | A hollow tree or thicket.
4 | The remains of a gigantic, dead creature.

Swarm of Stirges:
Swarms of stirges sometimes form in swamps and Underdark caverns, draining livestock and any other creatures that can't escape them.
