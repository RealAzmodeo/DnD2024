    <description>Balors embody demons' ruinous fury and hatred. Towering, winged terrors, these demonic warlords seethe with wrath, their rage erupting in waves of fire and as a pair of vicious weapons: a sword of crackling lightning and a whip of lashing flames. A balor's fury persists until the moment of its demise, at which point it explodes—a last act of vengeance against those who slew it. Demon lords and evil gods harness balors' rage by making balors commanders of armies or guardians of grave secrets.

    <description>Bandits use the threat of violence to take what they want. Such criminals include gang members, desperadoes, and lawless mercenaries. Yet not all bandits are motivated by greed. Some are driven to lives of crime by unjust laws, desperation, or the threats of merciless leaders.
	Roll on or choose a result from the Bandit Motivations table to determine the circumstances behind a bandit's crimes.

Bandit Motivations:
1d6 | The Bandit...
1 | Fights only oppressors.
2 | Is an ex-soldier who was discarded by their nation and now takes what they were promised.
3 | Is in a gang that views nonmembers as foes.
4 | Hesitantly serves a villainous leader.
5 | Secretly works for a government or a regional ruler to sow chaos.
6 | Takes what they need to survive.

Bandits are inexperienced ne'er-do-wells who typically follow the orders of higher-ranking bandits.

    <description>Heralds of doom and plagues on the living, banshees are spirits obsessed by unresolved bitterness or sorrow. These storied phantoms slay any who glimpse them or hear their baleful wails. Although any tormented soul can arise as a banshee, some elven communities particularly fear them and believe that those who hoard or destroy beauty—natural or otherwise—risk returning as a banshee.
	All manner of torments might give rise to a banshee. Roll on or choose a result from the Banshee Sorrows table to inspire how a banshee's torment influences its behavior.

Banshee Sorrows:
1d6 | Torment Compels the Banshee To...
1 | Appear prior to a family member's death.
2 | Haunt the site where it was executed.
3 | Lament a lost love and haunt their grave.
4 | Presage a disaster or tragedy.
5 | Seek the return of a stolen treasure.
6 | Slay those more beautiful than it was in life.

    <description>Infernal collectors, barbed devils fanatically protect troves of treasure and scour the planes of existence for additions to their hoards. Also known as hamatulas among the ranks of the Nine Hells, these devils bedeck their barbed hides with their most prized possessions and trophies taken from those who failed to steal from them. When threatened, barbed devils strike with their thorny limbs and hurl infernal flame.
	Barbed devils often serve as guards and accountants for ice devil generals, pit fiend warlords, archdevils, and similarly powerful villains. In return, barbed devils gain protection for their own collections. Many barbed devils also maintain networks of imps that search the planes for treasures of interest or usefully greedy mortals.
	Barbed devils rarely collect anything as prosaic as coins and gems. Rather, they pride themselves on having the multiverse's greatest collection of one kind of thing—typically items of rare pedigree or emblems of power. Barbed devils refuse to steal what they covet; instead they strike bargains to claim both treasure and mortal souls.

    <description>Barlguras are demons that embody brutality and killer instincts. They ruthlessly hunt creatures that enter their territories, whether such places are Abyssal wildernesses or locations where these demons have been conjured by wicked magic-users. Barlguras litter their territories with fiendish icons and terrifying evidence of their kills.
	Barlguras cooperate with other demons, particularly other barlguras, so long as they have ample prey. Should a region be depleted of creatures to slaughter, these demons turn on one another in frays that can devastate vast expanses.
	Barlguras vary in appearance, but all have powerful frames and hands capable of climbing swiftly and delivering crushing blows. If brute force isn't enough to overwhelm their foes, barlguras can use demonic magic to conjure terrifying illusions and grasping vines. Most barlguras resemble nightmarish apes, and some bear exaggerated versions of features of predators common to the lands the barlguras inhabit. Many embed trophies from past hunts in their demonic bodies.

    <description>Basilisks are ponderous predators with eight clawed legs, crystalline spines, and mighty jaws. Rather than chasing prey, they use their supernatural gaze to turn creatures to stone and then consume these victims at their leisure. While basilisks are most comfortable in subterranean lairs, many are captured and kept by unscrupulous folk seeking guardians for their treasures.
	The remains of Petrified creatures litter the area where a basilisk hunts. These might be mundane creatures or more unusual beings that had dire encounters with a basilisk. Roll on or choose a result from the Petrified Basilisk Victims table to inspire the statues that might appear in a basilisk's hunting grounds. There is a 50 percent chance that any of these statues are missing limbs or broken into pieces.

Petrified Basilisk Victims:
1d8 | A Basilisk Used Its Gaze to Petrify...
1 | An adventurer with an ornate key hanging around their neck.
2 | Animals like bats, bears, deer, or goats.
3 | A climber clinging to a stalactite.
4 | Itself using a large mirror or shiny surface.
5 | A mimic disguised as a chest full of treasure.
6 | A monster such as an umber hulk or a troglodyte.
7 | Someone caught in a comic pose or making a regrettable face.
8 | A victim now being used as a nest for insects or other vermin.

    <description>Bearded devils, also known as barbazus, fill the legions of the Nine Hells. These cruel soldiers follow the orders of diabolical generals as they defend infernal realms, invade Material Plane worlds, and clash against demons in planes-spanning conflicts.
	Left to their own devices, bearded devils encourage mortals to act callously and abuse their power, inflating their egos and inspiring petty tyrannies. Villains aligned with the Nine Hells call on bearded devils to serve as guardians, enforce their will, or fight in wicked armies.
	Bearded devils' eponymous beards consist of grotesque, tentacle-like growths. These squirming, barb-riddled beards carry poison capable of preventing magical healing. Bearded devils are also known for their distinctive glaives, through which they channel hellish energy. Those struck by these unnatural weapons suffer infernal wounds that grow worse until stanched or magically healed.

    <description>Twelve-legged, reptilian predators, behirs endlessly hunt for their next meal. Their short legs propel them quickly across floors and walls. Any prey that behirs can't chase down, they blast with breaths of powerful lightning.
	Legends claim the first behirs were magically created by storm giants during an ancient, multiversal conflict between giants and dragons. The giants used their mastery of weather to alter the essence of blue dragons. The results were the first behirs, which served as hunters with a particular taste for dragon eggs.
	Behirs live in sprawling cave systems and elaborate ruins where they can make the most of their exceptional mobility. They are mindful of areas where dragons dwell, as most dragons view behirs as dangerous abominations and attack them on sight. Nevertheless, behirs occasionally hunt for dragon lairs in the hope of finding and devouring unhatched dragon eggs.

Eye Rays:
d10 | Ray
1 | Charm Ray: Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 16. Failure: 13 (3d8) Psychic damage, and the target has the Charmed condition for 1 hour or until it takes damage. Success: Half damage only.
2 | Paralyzing Ray: Constitution Saving Throw: DC 16. Failure: The target has the Paralyzed condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.
3 | Fear Ray: Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 16. Failure: 14 (4d6) Psychic damage, and the target has the Frightened condition until the end of its next turn. Success: Half damage only.
4 | Slowing Ray: Constitution Saving Throw: DC 16. Failure: 18 (4d8) Necrotic damage. Until the end of the target's next turn, the target's Speed is halved; the target can't take Reactions; and it can take either an action or a Bonus Action on its turn, not both. Success: Half damage only.
5 | Enervation Ray: Constitution Saving Throw: DC 16. Failure: 13 (3d8) Poison damage, and the target has the Poisoned condition until the end of its next turn. While Poisoned, the target can't regain Hit Points. Success: Half damage only.
6 | Telekinetic Ray: Strength Saving Throw: DC 16 (the target succeeds automatically if it is Gargantuan). Failure: The beholder moves the target up to 30 feet in any direction. The target has the Restrained condition until the start of the beholder's next turn or until the beholder has the Incapacitated condition. The beholder can also exert fine control on objects with this ray, such as manipulating a tool or opening a door or container.
7 | Sleep Ray: Wisdom Saving Throw: DC 16 (the target succeeds automatically if it is a Construct or an Undead). Failure: The target has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute. The condition ends if the target takes damage or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to wake it.
8 | Petrification Ray: Constitution Saving Throw: DC 16. First Failure: The target has the Restrained condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still Restrained, ending the effect on itself on a success. Second Failure: The target has the Petrified condition instead of the Restrained condition.
9 | Disintegration Ray: Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 16. Failure: 36 (8d8) Force damage. If the target is a nonmagical object or a creation of magical force, a 10- foot Cube of it disintegrates into dust. Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: If the target is a creature and this damage reduces it to 0 Hit Points, it disintegrates into dust.
10 | Death Ray: Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 16. Failure: 55 (10d10) Necrotic damage. Success: Half damage. Failure or Success: The target dies if the ray reduces it to 0 Hit Points.</text>

      <name>Beholder Lairs</name>
      <text>Beholders lurk in cavern complexes they've carved using their eye rays deep in the Underdark or in lairs created for them by their servants.

The region containing a beholder's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

Scopophobia: Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the beholder and its allies) that finishes a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.

Warping Terrain: Minor warps in reality occur near the lair; any creature (excluding the beholder) within 1 mile of the lair that makes a D20 Test and rolls a 1 has the Prone condition.

If the beholder dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</text>

    <description>Beholders—also known as eye tyrants—number among the most notorious inhabitants of the Underdark. Few creatures in the multiverse are as loathed and feared as these maniacal horrors.
	A beholder's distinctive, globular body is dominated by an oversize maw and a gigantic central eye. Ten stalks ending in smaller eyes crown its form. From each of these eleven eyes, a beholder can unleash a different magic power. The central eye can deactivate magic, while the smaller eyes emit rays that inflict various dooms—such as petrifying creatures, disintegrating them, slaying them outright, or other effects.
	Beholders possess utterly alien minds. Most exhibit paranoid, narcissistic, and megalomaniacal tendencies, and they act on agendas beyond human reasoning. While some keep to themselves, others force weaker creatures into their service. Still others cultivate grand ambitions, creating networks of minions to manipulate groups, settlements, and whole nations in the Underdark and sometimes the surface world.
	Few creatures loathe beholders more than other beholders. Every beholder views itself as the physical and intellectual pinnacle of its species. To them, all other beholders are aberrant rivals to be dominated or destroyed. Conflicts between beholders can last for decades and lay waste to vast subterranean realms.
	Beholders are a particular threat to adventurers because both gravitate toward mysterious ruins and sites of great magic. Many beholders collect the magic items and petrified bodies of heroes they've defeated, displaying them as trophies.

    <description>Zombies are unthinking, reanimated corpses, often gruesomely marred by decay and lethal traumas. They serve whatever supernatural force animates them—typically evil necromancers or fiendish spirits. Zombies are relentless, merciless, and resilient, and their dead flesh can carry on even after suffering grievous wounds. While they can follow simple orders, they rely on primal drives rather than thought. They fulfill commands by working tirelessly or battering through foes, but they are easily stymied by barriers or unexpected circumstances.
	Zombies are usually created from Humanoid corpses, but the remains of other creatures can also become zombies. Such monstrous zombies might possess the strength they had in life or a measure of their supernatural abilities, but they employ such abilities haphazardly at best.

Beholder Zombie:
Zombies animated from the corpses of beholders retain some use of those monsters' magical eyestalks. These hovering corpses rely on their magic to destroy impediments and paralyze foes, allowing them to savage foes with their rotting maws.
	Magic-using beholders typically raise these abominations from the corpses of defeated rivals.

    <description>Black dragons delight in suffering and ruin. While other chromatic dragons scheme for power and wealth, these dragons seek to tear down all they see and rule over what remains.
	Black dragons are terrifying creatures with curved horns and withered visages suggestive of fiendish skulls. They typically inhabit stagnant swamps, crumbling ruins, or places of magical or environmental corruption. Their acid breath scars their domains, eroding the features from ancient statues and leaving nature with festering wounds.
	Black dragons hoard tarnished symbols of hope and relics of fallen empires. The more sought-after the treasure, the more black dragons prize it—particularly if they were responsible for it being lost.

Black dragon wyrmlings lurk in bogs and polluted waterways, hunting for prey and weaker creatures to overpower. While older wyrmlings eventually seek their own territories, recently hatched ones might hunt one another, seeking dominance over their clutch and slaying rivals they can't subjugate.

	Various supernatural conditions might bring black puddings into being. Roll on or choose a result from the Black Pudding Sources table to inspire a pudding's origins.

Black Pudding Sources:

1 | An ancient black dragon's acidic saliva.
2 | The blood or extreme emotions of a foul deity.
3 | Cosmic entropy or ruinous planar forces.
4 | A curse that transformed a forgotten tyrant.
5 | Forbidden or industrialized magic.
6 | Necrotic material animated by aimless spirits.

    <description>Blink dogs glimmer with a magic that allows them to teleport, "blinking" from one spot to another. These dogs use this power to chase prey, baﬄe foes, and express joy. They're frequently found among Feywild folk, such as centaurs and pixies—often as members of rollicking hunts between worlds.

    <description>The blob of annihilation is a coagulation of cosmic entropy conjoined to the remains of dead gods. This malicious entity drifts through Wildspace and multiversal expanses inimical to life—vast regions where the chance of encountering it is low.
	The blob poses the greatest threat when disasters or nihilistic magic-users summon it to inhabited realms. Once unleashed, the blob of annihilation rolls across the land in vast, cosmic gyres, with fragments of the blob splitting off to engulf targets. The blob consumes anything it encounters, sweeping forests, villages, and fortresses into its mass. Within the blob is an expanse without air or gravity where entropic forces destroy whatever they engulf. Nothing can survive within for long.
	Only magic items and the corpses of gods and titans can endure inside the blob. Because of that fact, treasure hunters and theologians sometimes give themselves the deadly task of trying to retrieve something from within the blob. This quest usually ends in annihilation, but occasionally it results in the find of a lifetime.
	When the blob appears, roll on or choose a result from the Blob of Annihilation Contents table to inspire what extraordinary thing remains within its goop.

Blob of Annihilation Contents:
1d10 | The Blob Contains...
1 | An A mulet of the Planes.
2 | An Artifact of the DM's choice.
3 | The corpses of two gods who were entangled in battle when the blob consumed them.
4 | A Cubic Gate.
5 | A Deck of Many Things.
6 | A magic key that opens a door in Sigil that no other key and no spell can open.
7 | The preserved corpse of an empyrean.
8 | The remains of half a kraken.
9 | The skull of a death god.
10 | A tarrasque that just died.

    <description>Arrogant and imperious, blue dragons are chromatic dragons that crave control and collect followers like other dragons hoard treasure. They seek to transform their territories into empires, domains to be feared by nations.
	Blue dragons have sharp features with piercing horns and scales that range from sapphire to the shades of stormy skies. They dwell in deserts and badlands, particularly regions with dramatic spires from whose tops they might see for miles. They seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised by their followers.
	Regalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill blue dragons' hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items capable of spreading the dragons' influence.

Blue dragon wyrmlings often serve other powerful creatures, learning the ways of control and establishing fearful reputations among weaker creatures. Many wyrmlings initially serve loyally, but as their powers grow to match their ambitions, they eventually betray or abandon their associates. These wyrmlings tempt small groups of creatures into their service, rewarding them with modest treasures and promises of future power.

    <description>Unpredictable slaadi devour and multiply across the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo. These toadlike, extraplanar beings embody the endless potentiality of their home plane of existence. While slaadi aren't inherently evil, their impulses are wild and often destructive. Many are driven to propagate through supernatural processes. Unfortunately, these processes typically are fatal for other creatures.
	Slaadi have no formal society. Rather, strong slaadi dominate weaker ones. Blue and red slaadi rampage across Limbo and spill into other worlds at the direction of green slaadi. More powerful slaadi have connections to the Spawning Stone, a source of chaotic magic from which the first slaadi originated. The Spawning Stone is hidden deep within Limbo, and legends tie its origins to the modron overlord Primus or the ruinous slaad lords, such as Ssendam, the golden amoeboid terror, and Ygorl, the winged skeleton. These slaad lords and others plot to spread slaadi across the multiverse.

Salad Control Gems:
A salad born from the Spawning Stone has a magical control gem embedded in its head. If a creature claims the gem, the salad has the Charmed condition and obeys the gem's bearer. The salad ceases to be Charmed if it is harmed by the gem's bearer or the bearer's allies or if the gem is returned to the salad. A Greater Restoration spell cast on a salad destroys the gem, and the salad ceases to be Charmed. One can obtain a salad's control gem using a Wish or Imprisonment spell. If the salad fails its saving throw against Imprisonment, the caster against the gem, and the salad isn't imprisoned. An Incapacitated salads control gem can be removed by spending 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Failing this check deals 22 (4d10) piercing damage to the salad.

Blue Slaad:
Almost as numerous as red slaadi, blue slaadi are muscular brutes with vicious blades extending from the backs of their claws. These claws carry a magical curse called chaos phage, which can transform victims into red or green slaadi. Blue slaadi accompany red slaadi and behave similarly. They innately know the signs of chaos phage and avoid slaying creatures that carry it or other slaad curses.

    <description>Bone devils are gaunt, nightmarish Fiends with pallid skin stretched tight over frames that combine human and insectile features. Also known as osyluths, these Fiends command weaker devils and other beings aligned with infernal legions. Bone devils ensure that the commands of hellish sovereigns are exacted eﬃciently and that non-devils fulfill their commitments to the Nine Hells. They slay those who renege on infernal deals, sending treacherous mortal souls to face unspeakable punishments.
	When not serving their diabolical masters, bone devils tempt self-obsessed mortals with promises of other creatures' adulation and obedience. These devils prop up petty tyrants, helping them grow increasingly calloused and amoral.
	Bone devils travel across the multiverse to fulfill diabolical orders. If left with no other choices, they might conscript mortals to aid them in their vicious goals. Roll on or choose a result from the Bone Devil Objectives table to inspire a bone devil's goals.

Bone Devil Objectives:
1d4 | The Bone Devil Seeks To...
1 | Capture a soul that escaped the Nine Hells.
2 | Convey a message or make an example of someone in the name of an archdevil.
3 | Find someone who broke a deal with a devil.
4 | Slay someone or steal something as part of its pact with a wicked magic-user.

    <description>Nagas are immortal but not invincible, and powerful magic can end their lives. Bone nagas are skeletal terrors raised from the remains of magically slain nagas or nagas that were killed but that hadn't yet rejuvenated. They are granted unlife through rituals practiced by cultists, yuan-ti, and morbid spirit nagas. These Undead nagas possess magical abilities similar to those they had in life, along with an eerie gaze that can beguile other creatures.
	Bone nagas typically obey those who resurrected them, serving their creators as tireless guards and sharing the lore they collected in life. Undeath disrupts the perfect memory bone nagas enjoyed while alive, leaving them with gaps in their memories or details scrambled into puzzle-like jumbles.
	In rare cases, bone nagas continue to pursue the goals they had while alive instead of serving other creatures. Most free-willed bone nagas are evil beings raised from spirit naga remains, but in unusual instances, bone nagas created from guardian nagas continue good, albeit confused, existences.

    <description>Gregarious and outgoing, brass dragons relish sharing knowledge and stories. Although these metallic dragons favor arid lands, they cheerfully journey considerable distances to visit friendly creatures, pass on what they've learned, and collect news. Though good natured, brass dragons don't shirk from combat when necessary, thwarting foes with magical sleep and searing them with flame.
	Brass dragons favor warm climes, particularly steppes and rocky or sandy deserts, and they usually dwell near prominent crossroads or oases that regularly draw visitors. They enjoy adopting Humanoid forms, disguising themselves as traveling merchants, scholars, storytellers, or anyone else invested in others' stories.
	Brass dragons collect eclectic objects. While such items might seem like knickknacks, each is part of a story—perhaps a nostalgic memento or evidence of a tale passed into myth. An old friend's hat and the crown of the last ruler of a forgotten dynasty could occupy the same shelf in a brass dragon's hoard.

Brass dragon wyrmlings are relentlessly curious. These dragons eagerly engage approachable creatures and are quick to explore any place that has an interesting story. Once they hear tales of adventure, many are keen to start their own quests.

    <description>Resembling mighty bulls armored in iron plates, gorgons are lifelike automatons that seek to destroy all who enter their territories. In addition to goring foes with their deadly horns and trampling them under their iron hooves, gorgons exhale gouts of noxious gas.
	Gorgons are created by magic-users to serve as guardians. The process for creating a gorgon is labor intensive and dangerous, with one method requiring the skeleton of a bull, the blood of a medusa, and the brain of a basilisk fused into a frame of ensorcelled iron. If the process fails, petrifying gas emerges from the materials, creating a magical threat that can fill a structure and linger for years.
	When magic-users create gorgons, they often enchant them to ignore those who confront the creature with a specific command key, usually a password or a specific signal. Once a gorgon is set to guard an area, it attacks any who enter until they flee or are destroyed. Should someone provide the command key, the monster ignores that intruder so long as the intruder remains in its sight. But if the intruder ventures out of sight and then returns without again presenting the command key, the gorgon attacks. Those in a gorgon's territory must remain vigilant and aware of the monster's exact position, or they risk being attacked by a gorgon they thought was no longer a threat.
	Those who create gorgons strive to give them purposefully obscure command keys. Hints at command keys might be found among the records of a gorgon's creator or in the area the gorgon protects—perhaps scrawled as a petrified trespasser's final act. Roll on or choose a result from the Gorgon Command Keys table to inspire the word or signal that temporarily neutralizes a gorgon.

Gorgon Command Keys:
1d6 | Gorgon Won't Attack Those That...
1 | Cast a particular spell in the gorgon's presence.
2 | Keep their back to the gorgon or otherwise act like they don't see the monster.
3 | Offer it a drink of blood, water, or wine.
4 | Recite a specific rhyme or sing a certain song.
5 | Say its creator's name backward.
6 | Wear a mask, perhaps in the shape of a bull or an animal meaningful to the gorgon's creator.

Followers of the exiled archdevil Moloch altered the process of creating gorgons to craft their own diabolical guardians called brazen gorgons. These gorgons are hollow, bull-like automatons whose metal bodies glow with intense heat. When they charge their foes, the ribs of their frames open like cages to ensnare enemies and roast them within. Brazen gorgons are often found in blasphemous sites dedicated to Moloch, other archdevils, or bloodthirsty gods.

    <description>Where bronze dragons dwell, wonders flourish. Imaginative yet mindful, these metallic dragons work toward greatness and help others achieve all they can. They strive to preserve innovations, from the works of past civilizations to new discoveries, and they share such works widely. When dealing with shorter-lived beings, bronze dragons prefer to win them over through conversation and cultivation, but they don't shy from battle when villains keep others from achieving their potential.
	Bronze dragons enjoy the power and endless possibilities of the sea, and they often make their lairs in places of natural beauty or communities they wish to preserve. Within their dwellings, bronze dragons hoard things they believe will be useful one day. They salvage treasure lost to the sea, reclaiming wealth or sunken ships.

    <description>Also called "land sharks," bulettes are single-minded predators that burrow under, leap over, and burst through obstacles in pursuit of their quarry. They burrow rapidly just belowground. On sensing movement, they erupt from below, attempting to catch prey in their oversize maws.

Bulettes range under vast territories. They often threaten animal herds, and they can wipe out whole farming communities.

Juvenile bulettes are known as pups. They travel in small groups, using their numbers to bring down larger foes. Their arrival frequently presages the appearance of an adult bulette.
