    <description>Winged, sapient horses of noble bearing, pegasi are as majestic as they are elusive. Most avoid the affairs of other creatures, preferring to dwell amid idyllic pastures or floating islands, or on other planes of existence. Others serve deities of the Feywild and Upper Planes, aiding heroes in need. In rare cases, pegasi might befriend virtuous people and serve as their companions and steeds.
	Pegasi are hunted by servants of evil, leading many of these winged steeds to flee strangers on sight. Roll on or choose a result from the Pegasus Offerings table to inspire how one might show their good intentions to a wary pegasus.

Pegasus Offerings:
1d4 | A Pegasus Won't Flee Someone...
1 | Bearing the gear of a hero the pegasus aided.
2 | Offering magical fruit or holy spring water.
3 | Singing a song in Celestial, Druidic, or Sylvan.
4 | Wearing the garb of an ancient heroic order.

    <description>Perytons are monstrous predators that hunt people—particularly humans and elves—in favor of all other prey. With the bodies of mighty avian scavengers and fanged, stag-like heads, perytons use ambush tactics to dive-bomb travelers. Strangely, the shadows they cast resemble humanoid silhouettes. This supernatural oddity lends credence to stories that perytons are cursed humans or elves, or that they arise from carrion birds that feed on the corpses of villains.
	Perytons tear out the hearts of those they slay, carrying the organs back to grisly lairs. This gives rise to numerous superstitions surrounding perytons. Roll on or choose a result from the Peryton Superstitions table to inspire why a peryton steals hearts.

Peryton Superstitions:
1d4 | If a Peryton Collects Enough Hearts...
1 | The hearts grant an evil wish.
2 | It reverts to its original form.
3 | A new peryton hatches from each heart.
4 | A portal opens to the Lower Planes.

    <description>Phase spiders appear out of nowhere to attack, then vanish just as swiftly. These horse-size, magical arachnids are endemic to the Ethereal Plane. From vaporous lairs, they peer through the Border Ethereal into the Material Plane. When they detect prey, phase spiders draw close and then shift or "phase" to the Material Plane to attack. They shift between planes of existence and attack from unexpected directions until they overcome their prey or are forced to retreat.
	Phase spiders are more intelligent than mundane spiders, but most are cowards. They usually flee if they're outnumbered by creatures capable of seeing them on the Ethereal Plane or pursuing them there. They make exceptions for ghosts and similar spirits, which phase spiders gain sustenance from and pursue as favored prey.

    <description>Piercers resemble stalactites, but each has a toothy maw and a single eye. They hang from cavern ceilings along routes frequented by denizens of the Underdark. Piercers might lurk for months at a time, waiting for any creature of their approximate size to pass underneath. When potential meals move below, piercers release their grip and plummet, intent on impaling prey in a single strike. If they're successful, piercers consume their meals and then slowly climb to a new ambush position. If they miss or fail to slay their targets, piercers attempt to squirm away, but they're easily dispatched by creatures aware of their presence.
	Piercers are the larval form of ropers. Young piercers seek to move as far from ropers as they can to avoid ropers' undiscerning hunger. Many piercers migrate vast distances through the Underdark, often to caverns or buried ruins near the surface.

    <description>The term "pirate" encompasses a broad range of seafarers, including vicious sea rovers, dogged privateers, cursed treasure hunters, and others who seek riches and fame on the seas.
	Pirates might be allies, foes, wild cards, or some combination thereof. While they are the bane of merchants and coastal communities, they know secrets of the sea and how to avoid aquatic threats. More unusual pirates set their sights beyond the waves, using airships, spelljamming vessels, plane-shifting craft, or stranger vehicles to explore and raid incredible realms.

Pirate Flags:
To terrify opponents and spread their reputations, pirate crews fly distinctive flags. Roll twice on or choose results from the Pirate Flags table to inspire what flag a pirate crew sails under.

Pirate:
Along with being competent warriors, pirates are accomplished seafarers who know how to sail and maintain a ship. While some loyally follow their captains' orders, others place greed, superstition, or self-preservation over duty.

Pirate Admiral:
Pirate admirals command whole pirate fleets. They undertake audacious ventures, such as challenging the navies of coastal nations, hunting legendary sea creatures, or carving out their own pirate kingdoms. Pirate admirals might launch their fleets from hidden fortresses where they hoard their treasure—or keep maps to where they've hidden their riches. Some pirate admirals ally with the followers of oceanic deities, underwater dwellers, and sea monsters, as well as their fellow scalawags.

Pirate Captain:
Pirate captains command crews of pirates, dictating their destinations and targets.

Many have colorful nicknames inspired by signature traits and deeds.

    <description>Masterminds of the Nine Hells and generals of infernal legions, pit fiends seek conquests across the planes of existence. More than warmongers, these diabolical tyrants concoct intricate plots that play out among fiendish battlefields, infernal politics, and mortal conspiracies.
	Pit fiends are the nobility of the Nine Hells, and many rule Lower Planar fiefdoms, doomed mortal worlds, and other infernal redoubts. Most serve archdevils of the Nine Hells as they pursue their own ambitions. Ranks of lesser devils obey pit fiends, but these cunning tyrants remain on guard against betrayal from their servants.
	Smoldering with the evil of the Nine Hells, pit fiends strike fear in creatures with their mere presence. Despite their size and incredible physical and magical might, pit fiends are as likely to try to corrupt foes as they are to destroy them outright. Pit fiends' arrogance can lead them to underestimate mortal foes—a failing that can lead to their downfall.

    <description>Planetars deliver the punishment of righteous gods. These angels innately know truth from lies, and they use magic and blessed weapons to protect the just and root out wickedness across the Multiverse.
	These angels act where they can against overwhelming evil, but to avoid the attention of the Lower Planes, they prefer to let mortals attend to affairs on the Material Plane. Planetars often choose mortal champions to oppose threats they're loath to face directly, involving themselves only if necessary. Roll on or choose a result from the Planetar Quests table to inspire what evil a planetar might recruit heroes to thwart.

Planetar Quests:
1d6 | The Planetar Entreats a Mortal Hero To...
1 | Convince a villain to meet with the angel.
2 | Find a loved one a villain believes is dead.
3 | Heal the loved one of an evil ruler.
4 | Inspire the defenders of a besieged holy site.
5 | Recover and destroy an evil Artifact.
6 | Reveal the true name of a devil to banish it.

    <description>Poltergeists are spirits that confuse and torment the living. While typically not visible, they sometimes appear as faded images of whoever they were in life. Some poltergeists don't realize they're dead and go through the motions of their past lives. Others are malicious beings or embodiments of fractured psyches that sow discord where they haunt.
	Poltergeists telekinetically move objects in the places they lurk. Roll on or choose a result from the Poltergeist Activities table to inspire how a poltergeist menaces the living.

Poltergeist Activities:
1d8 | To Torment the Living, the Poltergeist...
1 | Keeps returning a discarded item.
2 | Leaves footprints on vertical surfaces.
3 | Makes noises like someone trapped in a wall.
4 | Organizes a pack's contents across the floor.
5 | Playfully puppets a corpse or doll.
6 | Removes bedding while someone sleeps.
7 | Sticks knives or weapons in the ceiling.
8 | Uncannily stacks books, furniture, or utensils.

    <description>Created long ago by misguided mages, owlbears combine keen avian eyes, thick feathers, and a tearing beak with a mighty bearlike frame. Despite their magical origins, owlbears have propagated and spread to wildernesses across the multiverse.
	Owlbears dwell in distinctive dens. Roll on or choose a result from the Owlbear Den Features table to inspire an owlbear den's noteworthy traits.

Owlbear Den Features:
1d4 | An Owlbear Den Contains...
1 | Evidence of previous occupants, like bandits, wolves, or dragons.
2 | Heaps of regurgitated pellets studded with coins or other treasure.
3 | A nest with 1d6 owlbear eggs.
4 | Passages through the earth or hollow trees.

Primeval Owlbear:
Ancient forests and Feywild demesnes steeped in magic can give rise to particularly large and vicious owlbears. These primeval specimens can fly—albeit poorly—and emit thunderous screeches that can rattle foes and even tear them asunder.

    <description>Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow. There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these hoards fiercely. Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins.
	Many magic-users attempt to befriend pseudodragons, hoping to enlist them as familiars. The creatures' intellect and resistance to magic make them excellent companions, and they're considered status symbols in some spellcasting circles.
	Many pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don't properly pamper their pseudodragon familiars might be abandoned without warning. Roll on or choose an option from the Pseudodragon Treats table to inspire a pseudodragon's taste in gifts.

Pseudodragon Treats:
1d10 | The Pseudodragon Wants...
1 | Flamboyant accessories it can wear.
2 | Mementos from a lost friend or master.
3 | Outlandish delicacies—like axe beak-egg omelets or mammoth-milk cheese.
4 | The possessions of a sibling, rival, or master.
5 | Shiny gifts, from gems to abalone shells.
6 | Soft bedding and stuffed toys.
7 | A specific cook's signature dessert.
8 | Time-consuming beauty treatments.
9 | To hear a bedtime story or favorite song.
10 | Trophies and important-sounding titles.
