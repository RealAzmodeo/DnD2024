	While in bat form, the vampire can't speak. Its game statistics, other than its size and Speed, are unchanged.
	While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless and can enter an enemy's space and stop there. If air can pass through a space, the mist can do so, but it can't pass through liquid. It has Resistance to all damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.</text>

    <legendary category="lair">
      <name>Vampire Lairs</name>
      <text>Vampires and vampire umbral lords create sanctuaries apart from the living, whether hidden in cosmopolitan cities or sequestered in ruins where they dwelled in life.
	The region containing a vampire's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

Children of the Night: The vampire exerts influence over the animals in its domain. From dusk until dawn, Medium or smaller Beasts have the Charmed condition while within 1 mile of the lair.

Looming Shadows: Shadows within 1 mile of the lair seem to move as if alive. Any creature (excluding the vampire and its allies) that finishes a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.

Mists: The area within 1 mile of the lair is Lightly Obscured by a persistent, creeping fog. The vampire and any creatures of its choice are unaffected by the fog.

If the vampire dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</text>
    </legendary>
    <description>Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living. While the youngest vampires might be little more than bloodthirsty servants of their creators, the eldest possess incredible cunning and control over supernatural forces of the night.
	Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun's searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire's grim sanctuary.

Vampire Resting Places:
1d6 | The Vampire's Resting Place Is...
1 | Among the roots of a dead tree.
2 | At the bottom of a stagnant pool.
3 | A coï¬ƒn filled with grave dirt.
4 | A large pot full of blood or vinegar.
5 | A space accessible only by shape-shifting.
6 | Within a statue or suit of armor.

Vampire:
Vampires are terrifying hunters and manipulators. They use their powers to shape-shift and bend other creatures' wills as they terrorize and feed on populations over generations.

Vampire Familiar:
Vampire familiars are living people who serve vampires, either willingly or due to coercion by their deathless masters. They channel deathly energy through their weapons, incapacitating unsuspecting targets and leaving their victims as helpless prey for their vampire masters.
	Many vampire familiars aspire to eventually become vampires, while others are magically charmed or serve as part of some terrible bargain. In each case, these vampire servants show signs of their vampiric corruption, such as corpse-like complexions, uncanny reflexes, and evidence of their masters' repeated feedings. A vampire familiar loses its supernatural abilities and returns to its original Humanoid state if its vampire master is destroyed.

      <name>Vampire Lairs</name>
      <text>Vampires and vampire umbral lords create sanctuaries apart from the living, whether hidden in cosmopolitan cities or sequestered in ruins where they dwelled in life.
	The region containing a vampire's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

Children of the Night: The vampire exerts influence over the animals in its domain. From dusk until dawn, Medium or smaller Beasts have the Charmed condition while within 1 mile of the lair.

Looming Shadows: Shadows within 1 mile of the lair seem to move as if alive. Any creature (excluding the vampire and its allies) that finishes a Short Rest while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.

Mists: The area within 1 mile of the lair is Lightly Obscured by a persistent, creeping fog. The vampire and any creatures of its choice are unaffected by the fog.

If the vampire dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.</text>
    </legendary>
    <description>Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living. While the youngest vampires might be little more than bloodthirsty servants of their creators, the eldest possess incredible cunning and control over supernatural forces of the night.
	Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun's searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire's grim sanctuary.

Vampire Resting Places:
1d6 | The Vampire's Resting Place Is...
1 | Among the roots of a dead tree.
2 | At the bottom of a stagnant pool.
3 | A coï¬ƒn filled with grave dirt.
4 | A large pot full of blood or vinegar.
5 | A space accessible only by shape-shifting.
6 | Within a statue or suit of armor.

Vampire Umbral Lord:
Vampire umbral lords embrace their ties to the darkness, devoting themselves to sinister powers in exchange for access to forbidden magic.

    <description>Blights are malicious plants that sprout from deep-rooted evil. Their gnarled forms twist with fearsome features suggestive of human limbs and vicious maws. Blights lurk in ambush amid mundane vegetation and lash out at non-Plant creatures. While blights can act independently, they're usually motivated by whatever sinister forces spawned them or by wicked creatures with control over nature. The magic that creates blights often affects other vegetation as well, causing brambles, vines, and gnarled trees to overwhelm roads and fields, choke wells and streams, and force animals from their natural habitat. This might make blights the first sign of an oncoming wave of corruption.

Vine Blight:
Vine blights resemble humans wrapped in vines common to the areas in which they grow, from hairy ivy vines to flowering kudzu. They can cause plants to burst from the ground around themselves and entangle nearby foes.
	Unlike most other blights, vine blights can speak. They do so rarely, typically only to convey messages from their masters or to repeat the words of their victims in rasping voices.
