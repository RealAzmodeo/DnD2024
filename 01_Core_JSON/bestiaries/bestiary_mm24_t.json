A terror of massive size and overwhelming might, this primeval destroyer survives from the earliest epochs of the Material Plane, when it served as a weapon of immortal forces. Since then, the tarrasque has slumbered in secret, rising every few ages to usher in eras of destruction.\n\tThe tarrasque is a bipedal, prehistoric Monstrosity that stands over seventy feet tall. Bristling with horns and spikes, its spiny carapace deflects harm and can reflect magical attacks.\n\tThe tarrasque is a creature of tireless rage. It lashes out at any creature that catches its attention, thrashing with claws and its mighty tail while swallowing smaller beings whole. It seems to take instinctual offense at the works of lesser beings, venting its rage at buildings, bridges, ships, and monuments. The larger a structure or foe is, the greater the tarrasque's wrath.\n\tIt is a mystery what—if anything—calms the tarrasque, but eventually it returns to its slumber, leaving the world irrevocably changed. While the tarrasque might be halted by incredible opposition, its threat can never be wiped from the multiverse. Whenever the tarrasque is defeated, another tarrasque awakes somewhere else on the Material Plane.\n\tFew things survive the tarrasque's rampages, and reports of the monster's devastation are often contradictory, incomplete, or beyond belief. In cases where it leaves no survivors, its calamities might initially be blamed on evil dragons or magical disasters, but the tarrasque frequently leaves behind some unmistakable indication of its passage. Roll on or choose a result from the Tarrasque Evidence table to inspire what marks the monster's rampages.\n\nTarrasque Evidence:\n1d4 | Amid Destruction, the Tarrasque Leaves...\n1 | Evidence of a magic spell reflected back on its caster, like Ice Knif e or Melf' s Acid Arr ow.\n2 | Massive footprints or claw marks.\n3 | A russet scale the size of a knight's shield.\n4 | A shattered mountain or diverted river.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 305",

        "description": "Blights are malicious plants that sprout from deep-rooted evil. Their gnarled forms twist with fearsome features suggestive of human limbs and vicious maws. Blights lurk in ambush amid mundane vegetation and lash out at non-Plant creatures. While blights can act independently, they're usually motivated by whatever sinister forces spawned them or by wicked creatures with control over nature. The magic that creates blights often affects other vegetation as well, causing brambles, vines, and gnarled trees to overwhelm roads and fields, choke wells and streams, and force animals from their natural habitat. This might make blights the first sign of an oncoming wave of corruption.\n\nTwig Blight:\nResembling bundles of sticks or dead brush, twig blights easily blend in among deadwood, flotsam, and the wood piles common in many rural settings. Groups of them are often found near river crossings, forgotten wells, or natural campsites, where they ambush those who let down their guard.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 43",
