In return, barbed devils gain protection for their own collections.

This malicious entity drifts through Wildspace and multiversal expanses inimical to life—vast regions where the chance of encountering it is low.\n\tThe blob poses the greatest threat when disasters or nihilistic magic-users summon it to inhabited realms. Once unleashed, the blob of annihilation rolls across the land in vast, cosmic gyres, with fragments of the blob splitting off to engulf targets. The blob consumes anything it encounters, sweeping forests, villages, and fortresses into its mass. Within the blob is an expanse without air or gravity where entropic forces destroy whatever they engulf. Nothing can survive within for long.\n\tOnly magic items and the corpses of gods and titans can endure inside the blob. Because of that fact, treasure hunters and theologians sometimes give themselves the deadly task of trying to retrieve something from within the blob. This quest usually ends in annihilation, but occasionally it results in the find of a lifetime.\n\tWhen the blob appears, roll on or choose a result from the Blob of Annihilation Contents table to inspire what extraordinary thing remains within its goop.\n\nBlob of Annihilation Contents:\n1d10 | The Blob Contains...\n1 | An A mulet of the Planes.\n2 | An Artifact of the DM's choice.\n3 | The corpses of two gods who were entangled in battle when the blob consumed them.\n4 | A Cubic Gate.\n5 | A Deck of Many Things.\n6 | A magic key that opens a door in Sigil that no other key and no spell can open.\n7 | The preserved corpse of an empyrean.\n8 | The remains of half a kraken.\n9 | The skull of a death god.\n10 | A tarrasque that just died.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 47",

They seek lairs near sites of symbolic power, such as the abandoned fortresses of giants, the colossi of fallen empires, or monuments raised by their followers.\n\tRegalia of rulership and artistic masterpieces fill blue dragons' hoards. These dragons have no interest in treasures that are common or flawed, preferring one-of-a-kind gemstones, the crowns of fallen royals, and magic items capable of spreading the dragons' influence.\n\nBlue dragon wyrmlings often serve other powerful creatures, learning the ways of control and establishing fearful reputations among weaker creatures. Many wyrmlings initially serve loyally, but as their powers grow to match their ambitions, they eventually betray or abandon their associates.

These toadlike, extraplanar beings embody the endless potentiality of their home plane of existence. While slaadi aren't inherently evil, their impulses are wild and often destructive. Many are driven to propagate through supernatural processes. Unfortunately, these processes typically are fatal for other creatures.\n\tSlaadi have no formal society. Rather, strong slaadi dominate weaker ones. Blue and red slaadi rampage across Limbo and spill into other worlds at the direction of green slaadi. More powerful slaadi have connections to the Spawning Stone, a source of chaotic magic from which the first slaadi originated. The Spawning Stone is hidden deep within Limbo, and legends tie its origins to the modron overlord Primus or the ruinous slaad lords, such as Ssendam, the golden amoeboid terror, and Ygorl, the winged skeleton. These slaad lords and others plot to spread slaadi across the multiverse.\n\nSalad Control Gems:\nA salad born from the Spawning Stone has a magical control gem embedded in its head. If a creature claims the gem, the salad has the Charmed condition and obeys the gem's bearer. The salad ceases to be Charmed if it is harmed by the gem's bearer or the bearer's allies or if the gem is returned to the salad. A Greater Restoration spell cast on a salad destroys the gem, and the salad ceases to be Charmed. One can obtain a salad's control gem using a Wish or Imprisonment spell. If the salad fails its saving throw against Imprisonment, the caster against the gem, and the salad isn't imprisoned. An Incapacitated salads control gem can be removed by spending 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Failing this check deals 22 (4d10) piercing damage to the salad.\n\nBlue Slaad:\nAlmost as numerous as red slaadi, blue slaadi are muscular brutes with vicious blades extending from the backs of their claws. These claws carry a magical curse called chaos phage, which can transform victims into red or green slaadi. Blue slaadi accompany red slaadi and behave similarly. They innately know the signs of chaos phage and avoid slaying creatures that carry it or other slaad curses.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 285",

These Undead nagas possess magical abilities similar to those they had in life, along with an eerie gaze that can beguile other creatures.\n\tBone nagas typically obey those who resurrected them, serving their creators as tireless guards and sharing the lore they collected in life.

In addition to goring foes with their deadly horns and trampling them under their iron hooves, gorgons exhale gouts of noxious gas.\n\tGorgons are created by magic-users to serve as guardians. The process for creating a gorgon is labor intensive and dangerous, with one method requiring the skeleton of a bull, the blood of a medusa, and the brain of a basilisk fused into a frame of ensorcelled iron. If the process fails, petrifying gas emerges from the materials, creating a magical threat that can fill a structure and linger for years.\n\tWhen magic-users create gorgons, they often enchant them to ignore those who confront the creature with a specific command key, usually a password or a specific signal. Once a gorgon is set to guard an area, it attacks any who enter until they flee or are destroyed. Should someone provide the command key, the monster ignores that intruder so long as the intruder remains in its sight. But if the intruder ventures out of sight and then returns without again presenting the command key, the gorgon attacks. Those in a gorgon's territory must remain vigilant and aware of the monster's exact position, or they risk being attacked by a gorgon they thought was no longer a threat.\n\tThose who create gorgons strive to give them purposefully obscure command keys. Hints at command keys might be found among the records of a gorgon's creator or in the area the gorgon protects—perhaps scrawled as a petrified trespasser's final act. Roll on or choose a result from the Gorgon Command Keys table to inspire the word or signal that temporarily neutralizes a gorgon.\n\nGorgon Command Keys:\n1d6 | Gorgon Won't Attack Those That...\n1 | Cast a particular spell in the gorgon's presence.\n2 | Keep their back to the gorgon or otherwise act like they don't see the monster.\n3 | Offer it a drink of blood, water, or wine.\n4 | Recite a specific rhyme or sing a certain song.\n5 | Say its creator's name backward.\n6 | Wear a mask, perhaps in the shape of a bull or an animal meaningful to the gorgon's creator.\n\nFollowers of the exiled archdevil Moloch altered the process of creating gorgons to craft their own diabolical guardians called brazen gorgons. These gorgons are hollow, bull-like automatons whose metal bodies glow with intense heat. When they charge their foes, the ribs of their frames open like cages to ensnare enemies and roast them within. Brazen gorgons are often found in blasphemous sites dedicated to Moloch, other archdevils, or bloodthirsty gods.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 149",
