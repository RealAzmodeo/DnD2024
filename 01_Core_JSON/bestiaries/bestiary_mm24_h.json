Most half-dragons are created by chromatic dragons who desire servants with some trace of their own might and grandeur. Half-dragons frequently command other servants of a villainous dragon or act as agents in lands where their draconic master would attract unwanted attention.\n\nHalf-dragons share personality traits and agendas with the dragon who spawned them. Those resembling chromatic dragons typically loathe their creator even as they seek the same ends. Half-dragons with the traits of metallic dragons are especially rare, but they might arise through magical accidents, the efforts of reckless magic-users, or the last act of a dying dragon.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 163",

Their oozing hides are manifestations of embodied evils. Every few moments, patches of their slimy skins erupt with grotesque transformations such as rows of mismatched fangs, fungal growths, or half-formed features. These unsettling manifestations emerge, then roil away.\n\nHezrous serve more powerful demons, such as nalfeshnees and mariliths. They take the abuse and intimidation of these deadlier demons and pass it on to droves of weaker dretches and manes. This predictable brutality makes hezrous useful links in the chaotic structure of a demonic horde.\n\nWhen on the Material Plane or otherwise left to their own devices, hezrous recklessly indulge in destructive, short-sighted rampages. Only magic and threats from more powerful masters can curb these demons' outrages and compel hezrous to pursue greater plots. Powerful spellcasters often use sinister coercions, spells like Magic Cir cle and Planar Binding , or other magic to force hezrous to serve them. Roll on or choose a result from the Demonic Undertakings table to inspire how a magic-user might employ a hezrou or similar demon.\n\nDemonic Undertakings:\n1d6 The Demon Is Compelled To...\n1 Break open a vault and steal what's within.\n2 Defile a place using blasphemous symbols and demonic gore.\n3 Fetch or otherwise provide materials for a profane ritual.\n4 Guard a site and slay anyone who comes near.\n5 Hunt down a foe, destroying everything barring the demon's path.\n6 Intimidate someone into following orders.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 167",

        "description": "Hobgoblins embody the primal urge to grow and spread, expressing such drives by bending the world to their whims. Lone hobgoblins claim woodland territories and plunder the wilds. In groups, they form hierarchical, martial societies bent on conquering lands and stripping them of resources to serve their expansionist zeal.\n\tHobgoblins often subjugate animals, monsters, and destructive Feyâ€”particularly goblins and bugbearsâ€”to serve their plans. Hobgoblins might ally with dragons, warlords, the servants of warlike gods, or other powerful creatures that promise them control of new territories. Should hobgoblins bring an entire land to heel, they seek new conquests, venturing across seas, into the Underdark, or to stars and planes of existence beyond.\n\tMany hobgoblins serve the violent god Maglubiyet, whose hunger for conquest matches their own. Hobgoblin followers of Maglubiyet flourish in the Infinite Battlefield of Acheron, where they endlessly indulge their drive for domination. These war-obsessed hobgoblins employ elaborate tactics and strange weapons, which they sometimes unleash on worlds of the Material Plane.\n\nHobgoblin Warfare:\nThe drive to subjugate and pillage is part of hobgoblins' supernatural nature, though a few might repress their warlike tendencies or turn them to more useful ends. Roll on or choose a result from the Hobgoblin Strategies table to inspire how a hobgoblin carries out its conquest.\n\nHobgoblin Strategies:\n1d6 | The Hobgoblin Works To...\n1 | Build a vessel to carry hobgoblin armies to new conquests.\n2 | Capture monsters and train them to fight.\n3 | Collapse a region into the Underdark so riches can be sifted from the ruins.\n4 | Construct a giant machine to strip resources.\n5 | Convince devils, dragons, or hobgoblins from Acheron to invade an enemy land.\n6 | Help shortsighted merchants undermine a government or despoil the environment.\n\nHobgoblin Warrior:\nHobgoblin warriors might hunt and raid alone or with trained mastiffs, worgs, goblin gangs, or other allies. They employ simple tactics and exploit every advantage their allies provide. They willingly sacrifice companions in their pursuit of victory.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 170",
