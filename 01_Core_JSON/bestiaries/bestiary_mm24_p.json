They shift between planes of existence and attack from unexpected directions until they overcome their prey or are forced to retreat.\n\tPhase spiders are more intelligent than mundane spiders, but most are cowards. They usually flee if they're outnumbered by creatures capable of seeing them on the Ethereal Plane or pursuing them there. They make exceptions for ghosts and similar spirits, which phase spiders gain sustenance from and pursue as favored prey.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 239",

Piercers might lurk for months at a time, waiting for any creature of their approximate size to pass underneath. When potential meals move below, piercers release their grip and plummet, intent on impaling prey in a single strike. If they're successful, piercers consume their meals and then slowly climb to a new ambush position. If they miss or fail to slay their targets, piercers attempt to squirm away, but they're easily dispatched by creatures aware of their presence.\n\tPiercers are the larval form of ropers. Young piercers seek to move as far from ropers as they can to avoid ropers' undiscerning hunger. Many piercers migrate vast distances through the Underdark, often to caverns or buried ruins near the surface.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 240",

        "description": "The term \"pirate\" encompasses a broad range of seafarers, including vicious sea rovers, dogged privateers, cursed treasure hunters, and others who seek riches and fame on the seas.\n\tPirates might be allies, foes, wild cards, or some combination thereof. While they are the bane of merchants and coastal communities, they know secrets of the sea and how to avoid aquatic threats. More unusual pirates set their sights beyond the waves, using airships, spelljamming vessels, plane-shifting craft, or stranger vehicles to explore and raid incredible realms.\n\nPirate Flags:\nTo terrify opponents and spread their reputations, pirate crews fly distinctive flags. Roll twice on or choose results from the Pirate Flags table to inspire what flag a pirate crew sails under.\n\nPirate Flags Shows:\n1d8 | The Flag Shows A...\n1 | Buccaneer\n2 | Dragon\n3 | Fiend\n4 | Goat\n5 | Kraken\n6 | Merfolk\n7 | Skull\n8 | Whale\n\nPirate Flags With:\n1d8 | With...\n1 | A captain's hat\n2 | Crossbones\n3 | Crossed blades\n4 | An eye patch\n5 | Lightning bolts\n6 | A mug of ale\n7 | A tattoo\n8 | A treasure chest\n\nPirate Captain:\nPirate captains command crews of pirates, dictating their destinations and targets. Captains cultivate fearsome and theatrical reputations, painting themselves as larger-than-life characters to terrorize their foes, ensure the obedience of their crews, and attract followers to their banner. Many have colorful nicknames inspired by signature traits and deeds.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 242",

More than warmongers, these diabolical tyrants concoct intricate plots that play out among fiendish battlefields, infernal politics, and mortal conspiracies.\n\tPit fiends are the nobility of the Nine Hells, and many rule Lower Planar fiefdoms, doomed mortal worlds, and other infernal redoubts. Most serve archdevils of the Nine Hells as they pursue their own ambitions. Ranks of lesser devils obey pit fiends, but these cunning tyrants remain on guard against betrayal from their servants.\n\tSmoldering with the evil of the Nine Hells, pit fiends strike fear in creatures with their mere presence. Despite their size and incredible physical and magical might, pit fiends are as likely to try to corrupt foes as they are to destroy them outright. Pit fiends' arrogance can lead them to underestimate mortal foes—a failing that can lead to their downfall.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 243",

        "description": "Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow. There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these hoards fiercely. Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins.\n\tMany magic-users attempt to befriend pseudodragons, hoping to enlist them as familiars. The creatures' intellect and resistance to magic make them excellent companions, and they're considered status symbols in some spellcasting circles.\n\tMany pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don't properly pamper their pseudodragon familiars might be abandoned without warning. Roll on or choose an option from the Pseudodragon Treats table to inspire a pseudodragon's taste in gifts.\n\nPseudodragon Treats:\n1d10 | The Pseudodragon Wants...\n1 | Flamboyant accessories it can wear.\n2 | Mementos from a lost friend or master.\n3 | Outlandish delicacies—like axe beak-egg omelets or mammoth-milk cheese.\n4 | The possessions of a sibling, rival, or master.\n5 | Shiny gifts, from gems to abalone shells.\n6 | Soft bedding and stuffed toys.\n7 | A specific cook's signature dessert.\n8 | Time-consuming beauty treatments.\n9 | To hear a bedtime story or favorite song.\n10 | Trophies and important-sounding titles.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 249,\n\t\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 354",
