Often their appearance is enough to drive off foes, but if forced to fight, water weirds crush enemies within their fluid coils.\n\tWater weirds might protect a site for generations and learn much about their surroundings. Some gain reputations as oracles and might respond to questions posed to them in Primordial. Since water weirds don't speak, they often communicate using spouts of water or objects submerged in their pools.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 323",

Life is harsh and uncertain in the arctic expanses, glacial heights, and frozen seas where these dragons dwell. White dragons fiercely protect their territories, scouring the frigid regions for food and evidence of trespassers. Most white dragons ignore the plots of smaller creatures and other dragons, concerning themselves only with their own survival.\n\tWhite dragons create lairs to defend themselves from other deadly arctic creatures and from dangerous natural conditions. Within these shelters, white dragons hoard testaments to their superiority, such as monstrous skulls, the gear of defeated rivals, and curiosities that capture their interest. To protect such treasure, white dragons coax ice to form over their hoards or sink their wealth in frigid pools. For white dragons, each piece of treasure embodies a victoryâ€”the details of which inflate as these dragons age.\n\nWhite Dragon Wyrmling:\nWhite dragon wyrmlings usually head off on their own soon after hatching. While the cold means little to these creatures, food is scarce in arctic realms, and predators there are merciless. Most white dragon wyrmlings survive by scavenging, hunting opportunistically, and quickly fleeing foesâ€”including other white dragons.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 328",

Most are predominantly concerned with their next meal, and while they might converse with other creatures in exchange for food, few concern themselves with long-term bargains or keeping their word unless they have something to gain.

Despite their considerable strength, they're opportunistic hunters that target unwitting livestock and groups of encamped travelers. Wyverns usually land only to finish off creatures they've weakened with their poison and strafing attacks. Creatures that fight back or take flight might deter wyverns, convincing them to search for easier prey.\n\tOnce wyverns overpower a quarry, they carry it to their cavernous lairs to either consume it in safety or trap it to eat later. Most wyverns don't hoard treasure, but their lairs are littered with the possessions of past victims. It isn't uncommon for wyverns to carry off chests, carts, or small boats along with their prey.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 337",
