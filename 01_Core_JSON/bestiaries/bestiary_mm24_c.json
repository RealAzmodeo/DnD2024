Most operate as solitary predators, lurking in dismal subterranean reaches or abandoned dungeons—sometimes for months at a time—as they wait for prey to pass. They use their mottled hides to blend in with their surroundings. When unsuspecting prey nears, cloakers unfurl and attempt to latch on and then smother their victims in their powerful wings.\n\tCloakers delight in frightening foes. In addition to their methods of ambush, cloakers can create illusory duplicates of themselves and emit surreal moans that non-cloakers find terrifying in unexplainable, primal ways. Cloakers might antagonize explorers lost in the Underdark for days, terrorizing and scattering them before attacking. They rarely converse with other beings, except to whisper eerie riddles to those they're about to consume.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 73",

These giants resemble humans with hair ranging from silver to blue and with skin in cloudlike shades from stark white to twilight hues. Curved canines grow in their upper jaws, extending past their lower lips. In battle, they attack with weapons wreathed in storm clouds and throw roaring thunderheads.\n\tMost cloud giants inhabit citadels crowning tremendous mountains or magical palaces that drift amid the clouds. Many of these giants believe they possess similarly lofty status or purpose. Some view themselves as godlike beings who can manipulate and steal from terrestrial beings with impunity.\n\tOthers claim their long lives and place among the clouds grant them unique perspectives, so they chronicle what they witness in the world below without interfering. In either case, cloud giants often possess fabulous magical treasures, either claimed from across the world or created by (and gigantically sized for) themselves.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 74",

These gregarious dragons are fonts of patience, hospitality, and humor, and they seek to improve the lives—or, at least, the mood—of those they interact with. If forced to fight to defend themselves or their friends, these dragons favor using their slowing breath and physical attacks to subdue antagonists. Only in cases of extreme peril or emotion do they use their deadly acid breath.\n\tCopper dragons typically live in caverns amid picturesque hills and rock formations—particularly those that are prominent landmarks. These dragons collect gifts, though they have little interest in treasure without meaning, no matter how valuable it is. To them, thoughtfully given presents and the feelings or memories they symbolize are more important than masterpieces or magical relics.\n\nCopper dragon wyrmlings venture into the world seeking to make friends and discover wonders. They sometimes get into trouble, but those who help them can become their friends for life.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 78",

        "description": "Embodiments of prophecy and protectors of divine secrets, couatls ensure fate unfolds as it should. They resemble serpents with rainbow wings, and each is a manifestation of a divine edict, a truth or fate that a righteous god decrees must hold true for all time. Most couatls appear in places of ancient power, where they guard hidden magic or ensure foretold acts do or don't come to pass. Rarely, couatls watch over communities or travel lands in disguise, interpreting omens or manipulating factors to set fate on its proper course.\n\tMotivated by eternal mandates, couatls sometimes behave in inscrutable or antagonistic ways. They are inflexible and uncompromising, as their existences are fundamentally tied to their divine directives, but they harm other creatures only when absolutely necessary to achieve divine goals.\n\tEach couatl goes through a period of renewal at the end of an age. In a couatl's lifecycle, an age might correspond to a celestial calendar or some divine chronology. Near the age's end, the couatl lays a wondrous, rainbow-hued egg. When the age ends, the couatl dies. For a period—perhaps a single day, perhaps until an annual solar event—the couatl's work is unattended. Once this time passes, the same couatl that laid the egg hatches from it, fully grown and renewed to serve for another age.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 82",

Cultists often follow obscure mystical traditions or obsess over interpretations of ancient prophecies. They might worship supernatural patrons—deities, otherworldly creatures, manipulative alien minds, or stranger forces. Roll on or choose a result from the Cultist Agendas table to inspire what a cultist seeks to achieve.\n\nCultist Agendas:\n1d6 | The Cultist Strives To...\n1 | Bring about the end of a dominant order, an age, or the world.\n2 | Burn away the comfortable lies of reality, revealing forgotten or terrible truths.\n3 | Expand their faith through mind control or supernatural coercion.\n4 | Make global changes, like sinking the land or awakening volcanoes.\n5 | Remake life on a mass scale, altering other creatures' bodies or spiritual beings.\n6 | Summon their deity or its herald, weapon, or realm into their world.\n\nOccult Symbols:\nCults often identify with symbols that exemplify their beliefs. Such symbols might mark objects important to the cult, as well as the dress and bodies of cultists themselves. These symbols might be broadly understandable, or they might have meaning only to cultists. Roll twice on or choose results from the Cult Symbols table to inspire a cult's icons.\n\nCult Symbols:\n1d10 | The Symbol Is... Depicted As...\n1 | An alchemical sign A calendar or map\n2 | An animal A crest or as heraldry\n3 | A celestial body An elaborate diagram\n4 | A deity's icon A metaphorical image\n5 | An element A mystical being\n6 | An eye Part of an equation\n7 | A geometric shape A repeating pattern\n8 | A letter or number A series of scratches\n9 | Part of a monster A simple pictogram\n10 | A skull A weapon or tool\n\nCult Members:\nCults often form hierarchies around a charismatic or domineering leader. While cult members might work independently, they take their orders from superiors with greater supernatural powers. Any cult might have the following sorts of members.\n\nCultist Fanatic:\nCultist fanatics lead small cults or cells within larger cults. They're privy to more of a cult's mysteries than lower-ranking cultists are, granting them access to magical powers from their patrons.\n\nSource:\tMonster Manual 2024 p. 85",
