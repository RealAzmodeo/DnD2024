The information below details how you use those rules with Druid spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips. You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid spell list. Druidcraft and Produce Flame are recommended.\n\tWhenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another can trip of your choice from the Druid spell list.\n\tWhen you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Druid Features table.\n\nSpell Slots. The Druid Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1â€¢ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list. Animal Friendship, Cure Wounds, Faerie Fire, and Thunderwave are recommended.\n\tThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\tIf another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Druid spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Druid spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.\n\nSpells Prepared:\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 4\n2 | 5\n3 | 6\n4 | 7\n5 | 9\n6 | 10\n7 | 11\n8 | 12\n9 | 14\n10 | 15\n11 | 16\n12 | 16\n13 | 17\n14 | 17\n15 | 18\n16 | 18\n17 | 19\n18 | 20\n19 | 21\n20 | 22\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 79"

As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see \"Known Forms\" below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.\n\nNumber of Uses. You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\tYou gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.\n\nKnown Forms. You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see appendix B for stat block options). The Rat, Riding Horse, Spider, and Wolf are recommended. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.\n\tWhen you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.\n\tWhen choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.\n\nBeast Shapes:\nDruid Level | Known Forms | Max CR | Fly Speed\n2 | 4 | 1/4 | No\n4 | 6 | 1/2 | No\n8 | 8 | 1 | Yes\n\nRules While Shape-Shifted. While in a form, you retain your personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following rules apply:\n\nTemporary Hit Points. When you assume a Wild Shape form, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.\n\nGame Statistics. Your game statistics are replaced by the Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points; Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.\n\nNo Spellcasting. You can't cast spells, but shapeshifting doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a spell you've already cast.\n\nObjects. Your ability to handle objects is determined by the form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while you're in that form.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 80",

You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.\n\tIf you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement.

This form sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the Incapacitated condition, or use this feature again.\n\tWhenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form.\n\nArcher. A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to ld8 plus your Wisdom modifier.\n\nChalice. A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.\n\nDragon. A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 88",
