The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class's description.\n\nCantrips. You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance, Sacred Flame, and Thaumaturgy are recommended.\n\tWhenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.\n\tWhen you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.\n\nSpell Slots. The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.\n\nPrepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.\n\tThe number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels. 1 and 2 in any combination.\n\tIf another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.\n\nChanging Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.\n\nSpellcasting Ability. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.\n\nSpellcasting Focus. You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.\n\nSpells Prepared:\nLevel | Prepared Spells\n1 | 4\n2 | 5\n3 | 6\n4 | 7\n5 | 9\n6 | 10\n7 | 11\n8 | 12\n9 | 14\n10 | 15\n11 | 16\n12 | 16\n13 | 17\n14 | 17\n15 | 18\n16 | 18\n17 | 19\n18 | 20\n19 | 21\n20 | 22\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 69"

        "text": "Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.\n\tBecause their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn't rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.\n\tNot every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.\n\nSource:\tPlayer's Handbook 2024 p. 69"
